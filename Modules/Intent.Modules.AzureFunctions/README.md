# Intent.AzureFunctions

Azure Functions is a serverless computing service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables developers to build and deploy event-driven, scalable, and cost-effective applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. With Azure Functions, developers can write code in various languages like C#, Python, JavaScript, etc., and trigger its execution in response to events from a wide range of sources, such as HTTP requests, timers, message queues, and more. The service automatically scales to handle increased workloads and charges only for the actual compute resources used during the function execution, making it a flexible and efficient solution for building lightweight microservices, automating tasks, and integrating different services in the cloud.
