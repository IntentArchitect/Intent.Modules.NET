This module installs and configures `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`.

Swashbuckle.AspNetCore is a popular open-source library for ASP.NET Core applications that simplifies the process of adding Swagger support. Swagger is a set of tools and specifications for describing and visualizing RESTful APIs. Swashbuckle.AspNetCore integrates Swagger into ASP.NET Core projects, enabling developers to automatically generate interactive API documentation, known as Swagger UI, and JSON-formatted API specifications, known as Swagger/OpenAPI specification. With Swashbuckle.AspNetCore, developers can easily expose the details of their Web API, including available endpoints, request and response models, and supported HTTP methods. This makes it easier for developers and third-party consumers to understand, test, and interact with the API, promoting better communication and collaboration between frontend and backend teams.
