### Version 3.3.10

- It's now possible to control the `JsonPropertyName` attribute on DTO properties by applying the `Serialization Settings` stereotype which is available from the `3.3.11` version, or higher, of the `Intent.Metadata.WebApi` module. The stereotype can be applied either on a `DTO-Field` or the `DTO` to cascade on all `DTO-Field`s.


### Version 3.3.9

- It's now possible to have DTOs inherit from other DTOs.
