# Intent.Blazor.HttpClients

This Intent Architect module generates HttpClients for Blazor applications.

## Getting started

- In the Visual Studio IDE, if you haven't already done so, add a `Blazor WebAssembly App` to the same Visual Studio solution which is generated by Intent Architect:
  ![Visual Studio Solution Explorer with a Blazor WebAssembly App](images/vs-solution-expolorer.png)
- In Intent Architect, open `Visual Studio` designer.
- Create a new `.NET Project` with a name and folder structure which matches that of the Blazor project in the Visual Studio IDE:
  ![Create a new ".NET Project" context menu option in Intent Architect's Visual Studio Designer](images/create-new-project.png)
- Set the SDK for the project:
  - For a `Blazor WebAssembly App` set it to `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly` (if you don't see such an option, ensure you have at least `3.3.28` of the `Intent.VisualStudio.Projects` module installed).
  - For a `Blazor Server App` set it to `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`.

  ![Selecting the SDK in the Visual Studio Designer](images/select-the-sdk.png)
- Within the desired location within the project you wish for the `HttpClient`s and contracts to be generated, create a `Blazor.HttpClient` role:

- Install the `Intent.Blazor.HttpClients` module.

## Modelling service proxies

- Ensure you already have one or more HTTP endpoints already modelled in the `Services` designer. In the following example CRUD operations have been created for an `Invoice` class:
  ![Services designer in Intent Architect](images/endpoints-in-services-designer.png)
- Open the `Web Client` designer and select the `New Service Proxy` context menu option, upon selecting which the mapping dialogue will show.
- Select the available application and then select the endpoints to be included in the Service Proxy:

When you run the Software Factory, it will now generate the service proxies as well as supporting contracts and related types.

## Registering the HttpClients with the Blazor app's dependency injection

In the Blazor project's `Client/Program.cs` file, add the following line just before the `await builder.Build().RunAsync()` line:

```csharp
builder.Configuration.Add(new MemoryConfigurationSource
{
    InitialData = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        ["Urls:<applicationName>"] = "https://localhost:44321/"
    }
});
builder.Services.AddHttpClients(builder.Configuration);
```

`<applicationName>` above will need to be replaced with application name as generated by Intent into the `HttpClientConfiguration.cs` file.

`https://localhost:44321/` should be replaced with the URL of your application's `Api` project, in development you can get this url from the `Api` project's `Properties/launchsettings.json` file.

> **Note**
>
> The above example is using a [Memory Configuration Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/configuration?view=aspnetcore-7.0#memory-configuration-source) to add the configuration, but any configuration source providing the appropriate key will work.

The `Program.cs` file should now look something like this:

```csharp
using BlazorApp1;
using BlazorApp1.HttpClients;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Memory;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace BlazorApp1
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
            builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
            builder.RootComponents.Add<HeadOutlet>("head::after");

            builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
            builder.Configuration.Add(new MemoryConfigurationSource
            {
                InitialData = new Dictionary<string, string>
                {
                    ["Urls:Invoices"] = "https://localhost:44341/"
                }
            });
            builder.Services.AddHttpClients(builder.Configuration);

            await builder.Build().RunAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

### Attaching JWTs to outgoing requests

The generated `HttpClient`s will automatically include Bearer [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) headers in outgoing requests to secured endpoints, but they require security to already be configured for the Blazor application.

Depending on your authentication and authorization strategy, you may be able to use [one of the available options as documented by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/) and the generated `HttpClient`s should just work with no additional configuration.

If you have a custom authentication/authorization strategy, you may commonly encounter either or both of the following errors:

#### `No service for type 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.AuthorizationMessageHandler' has been registered.`

To resolve this, add the following line to your `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<AuthorizationMessageHandler>();
```

#### `Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.IAccessTokenProvider' while attempting to activate 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.AuthorizationMessageHandler'.`

You will need to create an implementation of [IAccessTokenProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.webassembly.authentication.iaccesstokenprovider) and register it as a service.

A simple implementation could be as follows:

```csharp
internal class AccessTokenProvider : IAccessTokenProvider
{
    public ValueTask<AccessTokenResult> RequestAccessToken()
    {
        var accessToken = new AccessToken
        {
            Expires = DateTimeOffset.MaxValue,
            Value = "<your access token here>"
        };

        var result = new AccessTokenResult(AccessTokenResultStatus.Success, accessToken, null);

        return ValueTask.FromResult(result);
    }

    public async ValueTask<AccessTokenResult> RequestAccessToken(AccessTokenRequestOptions options)
    {
        return await RequestAccessToken();
    }
}
```

You would customize the implementation to populate `AccessToken`'s `Value` with an actual JWT.

You can register your implementation in `Program.cs` with the following (or similar) code:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IAccessTokenProvider, AccessTokenProvider>();
```

You can also review [Microsoft's documentation on covering additional Blazor security scenarios](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios) for more information.

## Adding CORS to your Api project

If your Blazor App is hosted on a different BaseUrl to that of your API, the browser will block these cross-origin requests unless you configure [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) in the API project.

You can install the `Intent.Modules.AspNetCore.Cors` module in the same Intent Architect Application as your API, run the Software Factory and it will then apply the required updates to enable CORS.

## Using the service proxy in a Razor file

From within a `.razor` file it is now possible to inject HttpClients and call methods from them, the following is a simple example:

```razor
@page "/fetchdata"
@using BlazorApp1.HttpClients
@using BlazorApp1.HttpClients.InvoicesService
@inject IInvoicesService Http

<PageTitle>Invoices</PageTitle>

<h1>Invoices</h1>

<p>This component demonstrates fetching data from the server.</p>

@if (_invoices == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Id</th>
                <th>Number</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var invoice in _invoices)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@invoice.Id</td>
                    <td>@invoice.Number</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {
    private List<InvoiceDto>? _invoices;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        _invoices = await Http.GetInvoicesAsync();
    }
}
```

If you now run both projects, the page with the HttpClient should now be able to fetch and render the data.
