# Analysis: Intent.Modules.Application.MediatR.CRUD

**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19

## 1. Project Summary

The Intent.Modules.Application.MediatR.CRUD module provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) conventions for Commands and Queries using the MediatR pattern. This module automates the generation of standardized CRUD operations through strategy-based implementations, significantly reducing boilerplate code while maintaining consistency across application services. It leverages the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern through MediatR to provide clean separation between read and write operations, with built-in support for various data access patterns and domain modeling approaches.

## 3. Core Logic and Implementation Patterns

### Key Responsibilities
- **Strategy Pattern Implementation**: The module implements a comprehensive strategy pattern through the `StrategyFactory` class, which dynamically selects appropriate CRUD implementation strategies based on command/query characteristics and domain requirements.
- **CRUD Operation Generation**: Automatically generates standardized Create, Update, Delete, GetById, GetAll, and paginated GetAll operations using configurable strategy implementations.
- **Domain Integration**: Bridges domain entities with application layer commands and queries, supporting both domain constructor and domain operation patterns for maintaining business logic encapsulation.
- **Code Generation Orchestration**: Uses Intent's template and decorator system to generate type-safe, consistent CRUD implementations across different data access technologies and domain patterns.
- **Mapping Strategy Coordination**: Coordinates with various mapping strategies to handle data transformation between domain entities, DTOs, and persistence models.

### Identified Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Core architectural pattern implemented through `ICrudImplementationStrategy` interface with concrete strategies for Create, Update, Delete, GetById, GetAll, and domain operations, allowing flexible CRUD behavior selection based on context.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Leveraged through Intent's template system where base CRUD templates define the algorithm structure while specific strategies fill in the implementation details for different scenarios.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Implemented through `CommandHandlerCrudDecorator` and `QueryHandlerCrudDecorator` to enhance base MediatR handlers with CRUD-specific functionality and cross-cutting concerns.
- **Factory Pattern**: The `StrategyFactory` class implements a factory pattern to instantiate and configure appropriate CRUD implementation strategies based on model characteristics and template context.
- **Repository Pattern Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with repository implementations, abstracting data access details while providing consistent CRUD interfaces.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separates command (write) and query (read) operations into distinct handlers and strategies, promoting clear separation of concerns and scalable architecture.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Integration**: Supports domain constructor and domain operation patterns, ensuring business logic remains encapsulated within domain entities while enabling automated CRUD generation.
- **Extension Method Pattern**: Extensively uses extension methods for template and model enhancements, providing clean APIs for strategy selection and implementation customization.
