# Intent.Blazor.Server

This module extends a ASP.Net Core application to include Blazor Server.

## What is Blazor Server?

Blazor Server is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive and dynamic web applications using C# and .NET instead of traditional web technologies like JavaScript. In Blazor Server, the application's user interface is rendered on the server and then sent to the client's browser as HTML, with real-time updates and interactivity managed through SignalR, a real-time communication library. This approach enables developers to leverage their existing C# skills and libraries while building modern web applications, making it easier to maintain and secure applications while delivering a rich user experience.
