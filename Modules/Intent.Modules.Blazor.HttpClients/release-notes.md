### Version 3.0.0

- Improvement: Generation of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` attributes on DTOs has now been broken out into its own `Intent.Blazor.HttpClients.Dtos.DataAnnotations` module.

### Version 2.0.4

- Improvement: Changed default proxy encoding to UTF8 as Default can be inconsistent (https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.default).
- Improvement: Added better out the box support for generating proxies into `netstandard` projects.

### Version 2.0.3

- Improvement: Renamed the `request` variable as it would conflict with developers who would use that name for their service parameters.

### Version 2.0.2

- Fixed: `ReadToEndAsync` doesn't have a parameter in .NET 6 to receive a `CancellationToken`.

### Version 2.0.1

- Fixed: Nullability related compiler warnings.

### Version 2.0.0

> ⚠️ **NOTE**
>
> This module update will change the locations and namespaces of already generated service proxy `DTO`s and `Enum`s. If you are using these `DTO`s or `Enum`s in files not generated by this module, then you will likely encounter compilation errors due to now out of date using directives.

- Updated to use latest Service Proxy modules.
- Because it's possible for multiple service proxies to use a particular `DTO` or `Enum`, they are now generated into a folder structure per their source package.
- The `Template Output`s for `DTO` and `Enum` templates will now by default be placed in a `Contracts` folder in the designer. If you are upgrading this module from an earlier version then you may want to consider manually moving these `Template Output`s into a `Contracts` folder in the `Visual Studio` Designer.
- Service Interfaces will no longer be suffixed with `Service` or have suffixes automatically removed.

### Version 1.0.1

- Fixed: Not all referenced enums were being generated.
