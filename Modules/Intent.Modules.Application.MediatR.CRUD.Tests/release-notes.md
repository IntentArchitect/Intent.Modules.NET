### Version 1.0.1

- Fixed: Enums had invalid failure test scenarios being generated however it will now add test scenarios for when you have a "default" passed through to an Enum that doesn't cater for that scenario so that the validator can catch that.

### Version 1.0.0

- New: Module to generate Unit Tests for Command and Query handlers as well as Fluent Validation Validators.
