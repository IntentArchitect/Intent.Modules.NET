### Version 1.0.3

- Update: Small update in Configuration class.

### Version 1.0.2

- Fixed: Moving away from obsolete `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning.ApiExplorer` nuget packages for `Asp.Versioning.Mvc` and `Asp.Versioning.Mvc.ApiExplorer`.

### Version 1.0.0

- New: Apply version information to Commands, Queries or Service elements in your service designer to make use of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning` library. Add an `Api Version` (populate it with a few version numbers) and then apply the `API Version Settings` stereotype to the services you wish to apply versioning to.
