> ⚠️ **NOTE**
>
> This module update will change the locations and namespaces of already generated service proxy `DTO`s and `Enum`s. If you are using these `DTO`s or `Enum`s in files not generated by this module, then you will likely encounter compilation errors due to now out of date using directives.

- Updated to use latest Service Proxy modules.
- Because it's possible for multiple service proxies to use a particular `DTO` or `Enum`, they are now generated into a folder structure per their source package.
- The `Template Output`s for `DTO` and `Enum` templates will now by default be placed in a `Contracts` folder in the designer. If you are upgrading this module from an earlier version then you may want to consider manually moving these `Template Output`s into a `Contracts` folder in the `Visual Studio` Designer.
- Service Interfaces will no longer be suffixed with `Service` or have suffixes automatically removed.
