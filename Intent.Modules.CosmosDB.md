# Analysis: Intent.Modules.CosmosDB

**Last Updated**: 2024-12-19

## 1. Project Summary

The Intent.Modules.CosmosDB module provides a comprehensive Cosmos DB Database Provider Repository implementation backed by the Cosmos DB Client, enabling document-based data persistence with Azure Cosmos DB. This module consumes domain models from the Domain Designer and generates corresponding Cosmos DB implementation artifacts including Unit of Work patterns, Cosmos DB documents, repositories, configuration settings, and dependency injection wiring. The module leverages the Azure Cosmos DB Repository .NET SDK to provide a robust, scalable document database solution with support for multi-tenancy, optimistic concurrency control, and various authentication methods including key-based and managed identity approaches.

### Project Dependencies
- **Intent.Modules.Constants**: Provides constant value management and generation capabilities used throughout Cosmos DB configuration and document schema definitions.
- **Intent.Modules.DocumentDB.Shared**: Shared project containing common document database utilities, base classes, and patterns used across document-oriented database implementations.

## 3. Core Logic and Implementation Patterns

### Key Responsibilities
- **Document Model Generation**: Generates Cosmos DB document classes that map domain entities to document structures, handling serialization, deserialization, and document-specific concerns like partition keys and time-to-live settings.
- **Repository Pattern Implementation**: Creates repository implementations that leverage the Azure Cosmos DB Repository .NET SDK, providing standardized CRUD operations, querying capabilities, and transaction management for document entities.
- **Unit of Work Pattern**: Implements Unit of Work pattern for Cosmos DB to manage transactions, coordinate multiple repository operations, and ensure data consistency across document operations within a single business transaction.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Provides comprehensive multi-tenancy infrastructure including tenant-specific container providers, configuration management, middleware integration, and tenant isolation for SaaS applications.
- **Configuration Management**: Handles Cosmos DB connection settings, authentication configuration, database and container setup, and performance optimization settings through strongly-typed configuration classes and dependency injection.
- **Type Conversion and Serialization**: Manages enum serialization strategies, value object conversions, and custom JSON converters to ensure proper data representation and type safety in document storage.

### Identified Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Core pattern implemented through `CosmosDBRepository` and related classes providing standardized data access interfaces and encapsulating Cosmos DB specific operations and query logic.
- **Unit of Work Pattern**: Implemented via `CosmosDBUnitOfWork` to coordinate multiple repository operations, manage transactions, and ensure data consistency across multiple document operations within business processes.
- **Factory Pattern**: `EntityFactoryExtension` and related factory classes for creating appropriate repository instances, configuration objects, and document mappings based on domain model characteristics and requirements.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple strategies for handling different authentication methods (key-based, managed identity), tenant resolution approaches, and document serialization patterns based on application requirements.
- **Options Pattern**: Extensive use of .NET Options pattern through `CosmosDBRepositoryOptions` and related configuration classes for managing Cosmos DB settings, connection strings, and operational parameters.
- **Provider Pattern**: Multi-tenant container providers and client providers implementing provider pattern for tenant-specific resource management and isolation in multi-tenant scenarios.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Document interface adapters and type extension methods that adapt domain entities to Cosmos DB document requirements while maintaining domain model integrity and separation of concerns.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Document generation templates and repository templates that define the structure and implementation patterns while allowing customization for specific domain requirements and business logic.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhanced through Intent's decorator system for adding cross-cutting concerns like auditing, caching, and performance monitoring to generated repository and document classes.
