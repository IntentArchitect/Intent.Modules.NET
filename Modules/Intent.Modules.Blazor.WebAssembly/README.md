## What is Blazor WebAssembly

Blazor WebAssembly is a modern web development framework created by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive and dynamic web applications using C# and .NET instead of traditional web technologies like JavaScript. It enables the execution of .NET code directly in the web browser, making it possible to create rich, single-page web applications with a familiar and powerful programming language. Blazor WebAssembly leverages WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that runs at near-native speed in modern browsers, to enable client-side execution of .NET code. This approach provides a seamless way to develop web applications with the performance and capabilities of a desktop application while maintaining the benefits of web deployment and accessibility.
